# RNN Text Generation with Shakespeare's Works

This project explores the implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for text generation, using Shakespeare's complete works as the dataset. The primary goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of RNN models by comparing two different approaches:

1. **Using PyTorch's Basic RNN Cells**: An implementation that leverages PyTorch's built-in functionalities to quickly build and train RNN models.
2. **Building an RNN from Scratch**: A custom implementation of RNNs, allowing for a more granular understanding of the underlying mechanics and a direct comparison of training efficiency with the PyTorch-based model.

## Project Motivation

The main motivation behind this project is to gain a better understanding of how RNNs work, how they can be optimized, and how different implementations (pre-built vs. custom) affect training efficiency and model performance.
